          <p>
            I’m a computer engineering graduate and software engineer who learns best by
            building real products. Most projects in my portfolio started from concrete
            problems I wanted to solve and were developed into functional, working
            applications.
          </p>
          <p>
            My focus is full-stack development, from building clean, responsive user
            interfaces to designing reliable backend systems and APIs. I work primarily
            with Python, TypeScript, React, Node.js, Django, and SQL, and I have hands-on
            experience with cloud tools, CI pipelines, and relational databases.
          </p>
          <p>
            I believe in practical, iterative development: ship the MVP, validate the
            logic, improve the system. This mindset shapes how I approach both personal
            projects and professional work.
